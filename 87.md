Relay Management API
--------------------

`draft` `optional`

Relays may provide an API for performing management tasks. This is made available as a JSON-RPC-like request-response protocol over HTTP, on the same URI as the relay's websocket.

When a relay receives an HTTP(s) request with an `Authorization` header and a `Content-Type` header of `application/nostr+json+rpc` to a URI supporting WebSocket upgrades, it should parse the request as a JSON document with the following fields:

```json
{
  "method": "<method-name>",
  "params": ["<array>", "<of>", "<parameters>"]
}
```

Then it should return a response in the format

```json
{
  "result": {"<arbitrary>": "<value>"},
  "error": "<optional error message, if the call has errored>"
}
```

This is the list of **methods** that may be supported:

* `supportedmethods`:
  - params: `[]`
  - result: `["<method-name>", "<method-name>", ...]` (an array with the names of all the other supported methods)
* `banpubkey`:
  - params: `["<a 32-byte hex public key>", "<optional reason>"]`
  - result: `true` (a boolean always set to `true`)
* `listbannedpubkeys`:
  - params: `[]`
  - result: `[{"pubkey": "<32-byte hex>", "reason": "<optional reason>"}, ...]`, an array of objects
* `allowpubkey`:
  - params: `["<a 32-byte hex public key>", "<optional reason>"]`
  - result: `true` (a boolean always set to `true`)
* `listallowedpubkeys`:
  - params: `[]`
  - result: `[{"pubkey": "<32-byte hex>", "reason": "<optional reason>"}, ...]`, an array of objects
* `banevent`:
  - params: `["<a 32-byte hex event id>", "<optional reason>"]`
  - result: `true` (a boolean always set to `true`)
* `listbannedevents`:
  - params: `[]`
  - result: `[{"id": "<32-byte hex>", "reason": "<optional reason>"}, ...]`, an array of objects
